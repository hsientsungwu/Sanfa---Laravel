		<h4 class="subheader">What is Casing Sauce?</h4>
		<p>Casing or sauce materials are added to tobaccos to enhance their quality and to improve its nature taste by balancing the chemical composition and to develop certain desired flavor characteristics. For example, if a tobacco or tobacco blend is low in sugar (e.g., in the case of air-cured tobaccos), the smoke will often be giving a harsh and irritating effect. Sugar is added to restore a chemical equilibrium between the acid forming and base forming constituents of the smoke. This balance of sugars, acids and alkaline constituents varies by types of tobacco and must be carefully adjusted by the tobacco manufacturer to produce a mellow, full-bodied smoke. </p>
		<p>Moreover, casings are usually applied to tobacco strips or leaf early in the primary processing scheme to tone down or mute the strength or harshness of tobacco smoke, improve processibility of tobacco and add deep flavor notes to the smoke.</p>
		<p>Although each tobacco manufacturer carefully guards the secrets of his casing (and flavor) formulas, it is well known that casings for smoking products often contain sugar, licorice, cocoa or chocolate liquor and sometimes natural extracts. Of these, licorice deserves special mention. Just as sugar is used in "casing" the tobacco to mellow and smooth the smoke, licorice is used as an adjunct to boost the sweetness of tobacco products. The taste of licorice to the smoker is that of a mellow sweet-woody note which, at proper use levels, greatly enhances the quality of the final product. The amounts of casing applied to the smoking product depend on whether the tobacco is destined for cigarette manufacture or pipe tobacco manufacture. In general, pipe tobacco blends receive considerably more casing than cigarette blends, but again this is a matter of "balancing" the taste of the finished product.</p>
		<p>The casing mixture may be applied in several ways-the tobacco is either dipped in the aqueous casing solution or the casing is applied by spraying. Some manufacturers prefer to case the total tobacco blend while others case specific tobacco types prior to blending. Whichever methods are used, the tobacco must be dried prior to further processing.</p>
